-- üîπ Step 1: Identify the db_id of Schema `abc`
SELECT db_id FROM target_metastore.public.dbs WHERE name = 'abc';

-- üõë Replace `<db_id>` in the queries below with the actual db_id from the previous query

-- üóë Step 2: Delete Data in Reverse Order to Maintain Integrity

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from partition_params
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.partition_params
WHERE part_id IN (
    SELECT part_id FROM target_metastore.public.partitions 
    WHERE tbl_id IN (SELECT tbl_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>)
);

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from partition_keys
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.partition_keys
WHERE tbl_id IN (SELECT tbl_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>);

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from partitions
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.partitions
WHERE tbl_id IN (SELECT tbl_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>);

-- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from table_params
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.table_params
WHERE tbl_id IN (SELECT tbl_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>);

-- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from columns_v2
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.columns_v2
WHERE cd_id IN (
    SELECT cd_id FROM target_metastore.public.cds 
    WHERE cd_id IN (SELECT cd_id FROM target_metastore.public.sds WHERE sd_id IN (
        SELECT sd_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>
    ))
);

-- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from tbls (tables)
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.tbls
WHERE db_id = <db_id>;

-- 7Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from sds (storage descriptors)
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.sds
WHERE sd_id IN (
    SELECT sd_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>
);

-- 8Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from cds (columns descriptors)
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.cds
WHERE cd_id IN (
    SELECT cd_id FROM target_metastore.public.sds WHERE sd_id IN (
        SELECT sd_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>
    )
);

-- 9Ô∏è‚É£ Delete from serdes
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.serdes
WHERE serde_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT serde_id FROM target_metastore.public.sds
    WHERE sd_id IN (SELECT sd_id FROM target_metastore.public.tbls WHERE db_id = <db_id>)
);

-- üîü Delete from dbs (finally, delete the schema itself)
DELETE FROM target_metastore.public.dbs
WHERE db_id = <db_id>;

-- ‚úÖ Schema `abc` is now fully removed!
